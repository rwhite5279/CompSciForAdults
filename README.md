Introduction to Computer Science and Computer Programming for Adults
====================================================================

This small website was used as an outline for a short course in Computer Science and Computer Programming offered to adults in a K-12 community. The course met for five, two-hour sessions, once a week for five weeks. Students in the class had a wide variety of abilities, and not all of the material included in these webpages was, in the end, covered in the course. 

Still, it was a useful jumping off point for similar classes, and class participants gave the course a very favorable evaluation.
